## Samsung Watch Event Log Parser
How to run the parser:

The file is split into 3 methods: 
Clean(): Removes noise from the raw data. Noise is defined as a sleep stage lasting 1 minute or less. 
Enumerated(): Creates a version of the log where each stage has a number that indicates it's count in the current sleep.
Durations(): Creates a version of the log where each stage ahs a number that indicates it's duration rounded to nearest 10.

There is a main method at the bottom of the file that runs one of these, and where the rest are commented out.

Each method has an input file path, and an export file path. A sample raw samsung data file is provided to rest the parser.
